This repository is mainly about data mining
====
Data mining is really important, the core of data mining is washing data. The really data or first hand data is always difficult to deal with directly. We need to deal with these data ,wash them in order to adopt machine learning methods for our application.

The first practice is the Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data-Set
----

The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. Information was extracted from the database for encounters that satisfied the following criteria.The data contains such attributes as patient number, race, gender, age, admission type, time in hospital, medical specialty of admitting physician, number of lab test performed, HbA1c test result, diagnosis, number of medication, diabetic medications, number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year before the hospitalization, etc.

	(1) It is an inpatient encounter (a hospital admission).
	(2) It is a diabetic encounter, that is, one during which any kind of diabetes was entered to the system as a diagnosis.
	(3) The length of stay was at least 1 day and at most 14 days.
	(4) Laboratory tests were performed during the encounter.
	(5) Medications were administered during the encounter.

This dataset is complicated and unbalanced. Let's do it!
----
Look at the label:'readmitted',we visualize it by groups
![](https://github.com/BoXiao123/data_mining/raw/master/result/Figure_1.png)

there are three types of labels. We just regroup it to two labels.
		data['readmitted'] = pd.Series([0 if val == 'NO' else 1 for val in data['readmitted']])
